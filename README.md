Written Analysis:
The purpose of this assignment is to have a understand of which business line: Rural, Suburba, or Urban is doing better.  Using data and trends to improve business line that have opportunities to growth.  As business owner, it is critical to be able pull and understand data to manage business effectively.  In this exercise, business owners are able to see rider's average ticket sizes, geographics location, and weekly sales.  These data help business owners make a better decision to send additional support to certain location and time to maxim profits. 

There are some challenges during the process such as ensure data is accurate and clean before putting in graphs to analysis.  For this particular ride share's data, need have a period of time of data to understand the accurate trends.  We cannot take data over two holiday months and assume this is the normal trend.  During the holiday months, business would spike up due to increase in demand.  In addition, urban areas are busier during business in session compare to rural locations.

My recommendation to our CEO is to send additional resources to urban then suburban throughout the year.  Urban is making the most revenue due to higher demand.  The reasons could be more business convention centers or more economic for consumer to catch share rides than owning a car.  Focus on Urban business line will drive better revenue to company.  Rural is the lowest line in making money, but we still need to maintain our present as a way to adverstise and capture smaller market shares.An opportunity for Suburban area is after the month of April.  There is a spike in demand after the month of April, we need to send additional support. We can move resources from Rural line to support Suburban. 

Overall, using data and charts to have a better understand of business needs.  These charts could share across mulitple teams: HR, Marketing, IT, etc. Once all departments understand the needs of business can better make decision to be competitive in the market.
